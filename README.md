InfoGAN-PyTorch
PyTorch implementation of InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets with result of experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, SVHN and CelebA datasets.

Introduction
InfoGAN is an information-theoretic extension to the simple Generative Adversarial Networks that is able to learn disentangled representations in a completely unsupervised manner. What this means is that InfoGAN successfully disentangle wrirting styles from digit shapes on th MNIST dataset and discover visual concepts such as hair styles and gender on the CelebA dataset. To achieve this an information-theoretic regularization is added to the loss function that enforces the maximization of mutual information between latent codes, c, and the generator distribution G(z, c).

Usage
Edit the config.py file to select training parameters and the dataset to use. Choose dataset from ['MNIST', 'FashionMNIST', 'SVHN', 'CelebA']

To train the model run train.py:

python3 train.py
After training the network to experiment with the latent code for the MNIST dataset run mnist_generate.py:

python3 mnist_generate.py --load_path /path/to/pth/checkpoint
